### Hey there 👋🏽



My name is **Michael Owolabi**, a ✨ `Backend Software Engineer` ✨ from Lagos, Nigeria. I also write technical articles in a bid to make the learning process easier for others. I love to travel and enjoy adventure when not writing code/articles.

I currently work as the lead engineer at [Spleet Africa](https://spleet.africa/) where we are all about making living rental spaces 🏡 available to Africans.

I love everything backend engineering and currently fascinated by the possibilities of Redis so I'm exploring 🌱

I blog at [https://dev.to/imichaelowolabi](https://dev.to/imichaelowolabi) and hope to move over to my personal blog very soon...
